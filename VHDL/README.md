# LTC 2335 Emulator
An FPGA-based emulation of an LTC2335 ADC. This project targets a Terasic DE10 board with a Cyclone V FPGA and was intended to help test SYSB firmware development.
This VHDL module tests if the control signals generated by the microcontroller are according to the signals expected by the LTC2335. If the signals are as expected, it outputs a dummy reading according to the requested channel.
