# Portfolio
This repository presents some code snippets and files developed by me from 2019 to 2023. Codes are divided into folders according to the programming language.

## C 
The folder presents C functions that can be described as drivers or hardware abstraction layers between the main MCU and peripheral components. The folder also presents an example of Makefile and a bash script used to perform automatic code modifications. More details can be found in the folder.

## Python 
This folder presents a Python module developed to provide communication infrastructure between the main system board and the host. For more details, refer to the folder.

## VHDL
This folder presents some VHDL RTL block codes and testbenches. For more details, refer to the folder.
