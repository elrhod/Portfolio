# Portfolio
This repository presents some code snippets and files developed by me from 2019 to 2023. Codes are divided into folders according to the programming language.

## C 
The folder presents C functions that can be described as drivers or hardware abstraction layers between the main MCU and peripheral components. The folder also presents an example of Makefile and a bash script used to perform automatic code modifications. More details can be found in the folder. Also, in the same folder, you can find a code snippet that handles commands received using the Google Protocol Buffers. The protocol is generated using a [Python](Python) module that can be found in the Python folder. Fore more details about the developed C code, refer to the [C](C) folder

## Python 
This folder presents a Python module developed to provide communication infrastructure between the main system board and the host. It generates code for communication using the Google Protocol Buffers that allow communication using different languages. For example, this module can generate code for the host system running in Python and the embedded system running C code. For more details, please refer to the [Python](Python) folder.

## VHDL
This folder presents some VHDL RTL block codes and testbenches. For more details, refer to the folder.

## Rust
This Rust folder presents a program developed to test the communication flow between the host and the main system board. For more information, please refer to the Rust folder.
